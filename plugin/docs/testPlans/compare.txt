Test plan for MercurialEclipse's various comparison functionality

TODO: add variations for these situations: workspace under symbolic link, linked resources, repository root above 
      workspace root.


From the context menu
=====================

1. Compare with parent (without local change)
   Expected: The local file is compared with the file's previous change. Local resource is editable and savable. 
   Always in sync. Should work on rename.
   Current: Works
 
2. Compare with parent (with local saved change)
   Expected: The local file is compared with its clean copy. Local resource is editable and savable. Always in 
   sync. Should work on rename.
   Current: Works

3. Compare with to Another Revision (single file)
   Expected: Compare Editor shown. Renamed file is treated as different file. Not always in sync. Local resource 
   is editable and savable.
   Current: Works

4. Compare with to Another Revision (single folder/project)
   Expected: Compare Editor shown. Renamed file is treated as different file. Not always in sync. Local resource 
   is editable and savable.
   Current: Works

5. Repeat step 1-4 with unsaved local changes
   Expected: 
   Current: 

From the History view
=====================

1. In History view of a file, select two revisions and compare with each other
   Expected: Compare Editor shown. Three-way comparison is used when the two revision have a common parent.
   Current: Does not work before rename.

2. In History view select a revision and compare with current
   Expected: 
   Current: 

3. In History view of a file with no renames double click on a row in file history
   Expected: Show uneditable comparison of the two revisions 
   Current: Works

4. In History view of a file double click on a row in file history on a revision of a rename
   Expected: Show uneditable comparison of the two revisions
   Current: 

5. In History view of a file double click on a row in file history on a revision prior to a rename where the 
   rename source is a path under the project
   Expected: Show uneditable comparison of the two revisions
   Current: Does not work

6. In History view of a file double click on a row in file history on a revision prior to a rename where the 
   rename source is a path not under any project in the workspace (eg where src was renamed to plugin/src and 
   the project is at plugin)
   Expected:  Show uneditable comparison of the two revisions
   Current: Does not work

7. Repeat 2-6 but instead double clicking on the row click on the file in the "affected paths" zone
   Expected: 
   Current: 


From the Sync view
==================

1. In Sync view, file in incoming changesets of an added file
   Expected: File is shown in one pane, other pane is blank, uneditable 
   Current: Works

2. In Sync view, file in incoming changesets of an changed file
   Expected: File is compared with the changeset's parent revision, uneditable
   Current: Works 

3. In Sync view, file in incoming changesets of an renamed file
   Expected: File is compared with the changeset's parent revision.
   Current: 

4. In Sync view, file in incoming changesets that is based on an incoming changeset that the file was renamed in 
   (the file doesn't exist in workspace)
   Expected: File is compared with the changeset's parent revision.
   Current: 

5. In Sync view, file in outgoing changesets
   Expected: File is compared with the changeset's parent revision.
   Current: Works

6. In Sync view, file in uncommitted changesets
   Expected: The local file is compared with its clean copy. Local resource is editable and savable. Always in sync. 
   Should work on rename.
   Current: Works (except local rename?)

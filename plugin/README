Mercurial plugin for Eclipse
============================

MercurialEclipse uses Maven. MercurialEclipse depends on JavaHg and extensions for JavaHg.

1. Install maven

   - Install the command line tool

   - Install the Maven Eclipse plugin - m2eclipse 

2. Get the source code

  - Clone MercurialEclipse into your workspace as two projects - one for /feature and one for /plugin 

  - Clone JavaHg projects (recommended)
    - https://bitbucket.org/aragost/javahg 
    - https://bitbucket.org/aragost/javahg-ext-mq
    - https://bitbucket.org/aragost/javahg-ext-rebase
     
3. Set up the projects for build (Using m2eclipse)

   - In your run configuration dropdown there will be a 'MercurialEclipse-MavenInit' launch - select the 
     plugin project in the navigator view and then run this launch.

   - This will download dependencies and generate .classpath and other files

   - If there are Java errors related to Mylyn install the Mylyn plugin into your Eclipse

   - For each of the JavaHg projects invoke the maven 'eclipse:eclipse' goal. This sets them up so Eclipse will build them
     (like MercurialEclipse-MavenInit does).
     - Create a new 'Maven Build' run configuration for that project with 'eclipse:eclipse' as the Goal.
     - Refresh the projects after running this 

   - So that MercurialEclipse uses the JavaHg code from your workspace use the Maven 'install' goal. 
     - Create and invoke 'Maven build' launches with 'install' goal
     - Re-run MercurialEclipse-MavenInit launch
